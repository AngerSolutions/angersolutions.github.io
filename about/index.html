            The best way to contact me is:  anger.mgmt@protonmail.com  or by leaving a voicemail:  541-383-2961
        </li>
        <li>
            You can drop into a group as soon as you've received your workbook and completed the on-boarding session.
        </li>
        <li>
            I try to keep each group at around 4 people but can occasionally reach as many as 5 or 6 people.
        </li>
        <li>
            Everything is 100% online.  If you'd prefer to sign wet ink on paper I'll include paper forms with your workbook.
        </li>
        <li>
            The program must be completed within 12 weeks once you've attended your first group session.  It's rare for someone to completely fail out of the program.  But it's typical for each client to need to redo a module or two which entails paying for and attending additional sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
            I encourage group participants to reach out for help & clarification throughout the week.  So if you put in the extra effort then you can minimize or eliminate repeating of any modules.
        </li>
        <li>
            It's expected that you are willing and ready to confront thinking patterns, irrational beliefs, and inappropriate behaviors in response to feelings of anger -- and that you will commit to do so.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        I've attached some PDF paperwork, which needs to be filled out, to this email.  Please attempt to fill it in, to the best of your ability, and then email back the completed forms for review.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will email you a $20 invoice for a workbook.  The sooner I can get the workbook mailed out to you, the better.  (Please either send me your mailing address or make sure it's correct in the Paypal invoice)
    </p>
    <p>
        I will also include paper forms with the workbook, if you'd rather fill those out and send me photos of them, instead of using the electronic (PDF) documents.

        Please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions!
