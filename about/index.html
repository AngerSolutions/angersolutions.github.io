        Here are the details for the program...
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        It's expected that participants are willing and ready to confront thinking patterns, irrational beliefs, and inappropriate behaviors in response to feelings of anger -- and that they will commit to doing so.

    <ul>
        <li>
            One on-boarding session; followed by a minimum of 8 weekly classes; Typically 1 - 2 hours in length.
        </li>
        <li>
            $20 workbook;  $50 on-boarding;  $30 per weekly group x 8 (12 groups max).

            New clients can drop into a group as soon as they've received their workbook and completed the on-boarding session.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each group is ideally kept to around 4 people but they occasionally reach as many as 5 or 6 people.
        </li>
        <li>
            Everything is 100% online.  Paper forms will be mailed with the workbook for people who prefer to avoid electronic forms.
        </li>
        <li>
            The program must be completed within 12 weeks once participants have attended their first group session.  It's rare for someone to completely fail out of the program.  But it's typical for each client to need to redo a module or two which entails paying for and attending additional sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Group participants are encouraged to reach out for help & clarification throughout the week.  So if one puts in the extra effort then they can minimize or eliminate repeating of any modules.
        </li>
