About Anger Solutions
=====================

Here are the details for the program...
---------------------------------------

It's expected that participants are willing and ready to confront thinking patterns, irrational beliefs, and inappropriate behaviors in response to feelings of anger -- and that they will commit to doing so.


* One on-boarding session; followed by a minimum of 8 weekly classes; Typically 1 - 2 hours in length.
* **$20** workbook; **$50** on-boarding; **$30** per weekly group x 8 (**12 groups max**).
* The best way to contact me is: [anger.mgmt@protonmail.com](mailto:anger.mgmt@protonmail.com) or by leaving a voicemail: [541-383-2961](tel:5413832961)
* You can drop into a group as soon as you've received your workbook and completed the on-boarding session.
* Each group is ideally kept to around 4 people.
* Everything is **100% online**. _Paper forms will be mailed with the workbook for people who prefer to avoid electronic forms._
* The program **must be completed within 12 weeks** once participants have attended their first group session. It's rare for someone to completely fail out of the program. But **it's typical for each client to need to redo a module** or two which entails paying for and attending additional sessions.
* Group participants are encouraged to **reach out for help & clarification throughout the week**. So if one puts in the extra effort then they can minimize or even eliminate needing to repeat any modules.
