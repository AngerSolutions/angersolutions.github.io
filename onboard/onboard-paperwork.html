        <p>
            The confidentiality of client records maintained by this agency
            is protected by Federal Law and regulations.  In general, this

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The client consents, in writing.

            <li>
                The disclosure is allowed, or required by court order.
            </li>
            <li>
                The disclosure is made to medical personnel in a medical

        </ul>
        <p>
            Violation of the Federal regulations is a crime and may be
            reported to the appropriate authorities in accordance with
            Federal law.

        <p>
            The Federal law and regulations <u><b>do not</u></b> protect any information

            against any person who works for the program, or any threat to
            commit such a crime.  Nor does it the law protect any information
            about suspected <u><b>child/elder abuse or neglect</u></b> which must be
            reported under State law to appropriate State or Local
            authorities.

            I understand that if I have been court ordered to attend this
            program, it has been documented that I have been violent.  A
            requirement for participation in the program includes my taking
            responsibility for my actions and talking about my violence.
            In the event that I deny being violent, Anger Solutions will have
            no choice but to refer me back to court.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            I agree to attend a minimum of 8 group sessions with Anger
            Solutions.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            I understand that the group facilitator will report my attendance,
            acts of violence, and an evaluation of my progress to the court
            and/or their agents.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            I understand that any violation of conditions of the program or
            probation are grounds for removal from group and referral back
            to court.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            I understand that if I move, while I'm attending the program, I must notify this agency of change of address and that this program can only be provided within the state of Oregon, to Oregon residents.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            I agree not to be violent with any person during my participation
            in the "Coping With Anger" cognitive-behavorial program.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            I understand that missing a group or redoing a module counts
            as a "strike" and that after 5 strikes I will need to purchase a
            new workbook and restart the program.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            I understand that the work materials for "Coping With Anger" are

            need to be replaced at my expense.

        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            The "Coping With Anger" anger management group is designed to
            assist each participant to develop an awareness of the impact of
            "anger" in their life, develop an understanding of what causes
            anger, and to provide each participant with some basic tools to
            manage anger more effectively.  The treatment concepts and anger
            management tools presented in this group are evidence based and
            have demonstrated effectiveness in helping individuals manage
            anger.  As with learning any new skills and behaviors, practice
            is an essential part of getting the most from this group.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            All participants must sign a Release of Information (ROI) form
            for their referring agent.  If you are unwilling to sign an ROI
            or revoke your ROI to your referring agent then notification will
            be made to your parole/probation officer and/or referring agent and you
            will no longer be able to attend the group until you have discussed
            the issue with your parole/probation officer.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            Participant progress and attendance at each group is reported to
            the Court of supervision and/or responsible parole/probation
            officer.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            The anger management group meets weekly, at 6:30 PM.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            Group participants will need to purchase the "Coping With Anger"
            workbook, for $20, and read and complete Module 1 prior to the
            first group session.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            Participants are required to have their device plugged-in and

            meeting.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            The "Coping With Anger" program can be completed in 8 sessions.
            However, if you do not complete your work to the satisfaction of
            voting group members and/or the group facilitator, you will asked
            to redo the work and re-present it the following week.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            Any additional group sessions will incur an additional cost of
            $30 per session, due before that sessions begins.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            A participant will not be admitted to a session or may be dismissed
            from a group session if:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    They present as intoxicated or "high".
                </li>
                <li>
                    They become verbally disruptive and/or threatening during
                    the group.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            Participants will not be admitted to a session if they do not
            arrive prior to the beginning of the session and will not be
            given credit for the session if they leave before being
            dismissed, at the end of the session.
        </label>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" />
            If you are removed from a group session, it will count as one
            absence, and you will be permitted to return to the next group
            session after discussing the situation with your Court of
            supervision and/or probation officer.

            Redoing modules and/or failing to attend the weekly group 5 times
            (combined total) may result in "unsuccessful completion" of the
            program and notification will be forwarded to your Court of
            supervision and parole/probation officer.
