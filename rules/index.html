        RULES FOR GROUP - Subject to change without notice
    </h1>

    <h2>
        EMAIL
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            ALWAYS send a new email for EACH question;  Do NOT reply to old or unrelated email threads.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do NOT combine emails.
            ONLY ONE SUBJECT per message.
        </li>
        <li>
            DO NOT FORWARD EMAILS TO OTHERS.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you CC others on a message MAKE IT VERY OBVIOUS, at the very TOP of the message, that you've CC'd others;
            Otherwise don't CC anybody and simply ask, if you want them contacted.
        </li>
        <li>
            I typically delete emails after viewing them, for privacy reasons, so please don't assume that I still have them.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        Homework
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's expected you COMPLETE AND EMAIL PHOTOS
            OF EACH MODULE BEFORE GROUP begins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Homework will NOT be "reviewed".  You'll need to
            iron out any issues with your homework, before
            submitting it, by asking specific questions -- with each question in a fresh email.<br />
            Do NOT revive old or unrelated threads.<br />
            <br />
            When in doubt: Dialing the telephone number and leaving a voice message is virtually fool-proof.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each homework submission MUST be in its own, fresh email. --Not in a reply to some other thread.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only ONE homework attachment is allowed, per week. --THAT is your homework submission.
        </li>
        <li>
            Homework submissions MUST include the module number in the "Subject" line;<br />
            ONLY homework submissions may reference the module number in the "Subject" line.<br />
            Do NOT place a module number in any other emails -- ONLY in your homework submission.
        </li>
        <li>
            All images MUST be upright and legible.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you fail to EMAIL YOUR COMPLETED HOMEWORK,
            between the day following the current group and the next session,
            then you won't progress to the next module.
        </li>
        <li>
            I do NOT retain the previous week's assignment emails.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you think you might cut it close making it
            to group on-time then take your workbook,
            a pencil, and phone with you so you can still
            participate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Show up, even if you didn't complete your homework, if you want your weekly report to state you were "present" and "in compliance".
        </li>
        <li>
            PRINT answers, DO NOT USE CURSIVE, so it's easy to read.<br />
            USE A PENCIL so answers are easy to change, when necessary.<br />
            Do NOT write, draw, or discuss anything you don't want anyone to know.
        </li>
        <li>
            ALWAYS SEND ONE COMPLETE HOMEWORK SUBMISSION, per week, in its very own email.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional homework may be assigned at ANY time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most people end up redoing one or more modules.<br />
            Module redoes are not free.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        CONNECTION
    </h2>
        
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your device is expected to be plugged in, at ALL times.
            If your battery is dying do NOT interrupt the group.
            Handle it on your own.  It's NOT our problem.
        <li>
            If your connection drops, REJOIN MUTED.
            Don't start apologizing when you reconnect.
            --The group will continue without you.
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    <h2>
        PARTICIPATION
    </h2>
        
    <ul>
        <li>
            This is NOT counseling;<br />
            This is NOT therapy;<br />
            The group facilitator is neither a counselor, nor a therapist.
        </li>
        <li>
            You're strongly encouraged to use your initials, for your username, in this group.<br />
            At most, please use only your first name and last initial.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most of the groups start at 6:30 PM.<br />
            6:31 is late; 6:35 is a no-show;<br />
            Always be respectful and on-time.
        </li>
        <li>
            The average session lasts
            an hour & half to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li style="background-color:#ef0fff;color:#ffffff;">
            FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS VERY CAREFULLY.
        </li>
        <li>
            EVERYTHING DISCUSSED HERE SHOULD BE
            TAKEN AS CONFIDENTIAL;<br />
            What's said in group should stay in group.<br />
            Wear headphones if anyone is nearby.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, confidentiality can NOT be guaranteed.<br />
            So do NOT admit to any specific crimes.
        </li>
        <li>
            You're encourage to CHIME IN if you have
            additional ideas about the portion of the
            module we're covering.  So please consider
            adding to the answers given by others and
            asking clarifying questions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any disrespect to this group will REQUIRE AN APOLOGY.<br />
            Absolutely NO THREATS and NO VIOLENCE.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do NOT violate ANY restraining orders or no-contact orders,
            ever, not even as part of an assignment.
        </li>
        <li>
            NO arguing; NO excuses; Please ASK to explain.<br />
            Continuing to argue will result in failure to progress.
        </li>
        <li>
            When speaking, FOCUS ON YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS.<br />
            YOU ARE THE PERPETRATOR, NOT THE VICTIM.
        </li>
        <li>
            Everybody has reasons...
            When speaking, focus on WHAT YOU DID, NOT WHY you did it.<br />
            If we need to know why we'll ask.
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow the K.I.S.S. principle: "Keep It Short & Simple"<br />
            This means keep your answers as short & simple, as possible.<br />
            --2 to 3 sentences is usually plenty! Let us ask for more information, if we need it.<br />
            Otherwise you'll probably end up exposing more than necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Giving "reasons" can lead to failure.<br />
            --Unless they are specifically called for (otherwise they're "excuses").
        </li>
    </ul>
