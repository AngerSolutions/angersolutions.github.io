    <h2>
        HOMEWORK
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            You must EMAIL PHOTOS of your completed homework ONCE, EACH WEEK, BEFORE GROUP begins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Homework will NOT be "reviewed" after submission.
        </li>
        <li>
            Iron out any issues with your homework BEFORE SUBMITTING it, by asking specific questions.<br />
            Put each question in it's own, fresh, email;<br />
            Do NOT revive old or unrelated threads.<br />
            <span class="highlight">When in doubt: Dial <a href="tel:5413832961" class="bold">(541)383-2961</a> and LEAVE A <span class="bold">VOICE</span> MESSAGE.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each homework submission MUST be in its own, fresh email.<br />
            --Not in a reply to some other thread.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only ONE homework attachment is allowed, per week.<br />
            --THAT is your homework submission.
        </li>
        <li>
            Homework submissions MUST include the module number in the "Subject" line;<br />
            ONLY homework submissions may reference the module number in the "Subject" line.<br />
            Do NOT place a module number in any other emails -- ONLY in your homework submission.
        </li>
        <li>
            All images MUST be upright and legible.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you fail to EMAIL YOUR COMPLETED HOMEWORK,<br />
            between the day following the current group and the next session,<br />
            then you won't progress to the next module.
        </li>
        <li>
            I do NOT retain the previous week's assignment emails.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you think you might cut it close making it
            to group on-time then take your workbook,
            a pencil, and phone with you so you can still
            participate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Show up, even if you didn't complete your homework, if you want your weekly report to state you were "present" and "in compliance".
        </li>
        <li>
            PRINT answers, DO NOT USE CURSIVE, so it's easy to read.<br />
            USE A PENCIL so answers are easy to change, when necessary.<br />
            Do NOT write, draw, or discuss anything you don't want anyone to know.
        </li>
        <li>
            ALWAYS SEND ONE COMPLETE HOMEWORK SUBMISSION, per week, in its very own email.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional homework may be assigned at ANY time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most people end up redoing one or more modules.<br />
            Module redoes are not free.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        CONNECTION
    </h2>
        
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your device is expected to be plugged in, at ALL times.<br />
            If your battery is dying do NOT interrupt the group.<br />
            Handle it on your own.  It's NOT our problem.
        <li>
            If your connection drops, REJOIN MUTED.<br />
            Don't start apologizing when you reconnect.<br />
            --The group will continue without you.
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    <h2>
        PARTICIPATION
    </h2>
        
    <ul>
        <li>
            This is NOT counseling;<br />
            This is NOT therapy;<br />
            The group facilitator is neither a counselor, nor a therapist.
        </li>
        <li>
            You're strongly encouraged to use your initials, for your username, in this group.<br />
            At most, please use only your first name and last initial.
        </li>
        <li>
            Always be respectful and on-time.<br />
            After 1 minute you're late;<br />
            After 5 minutes you're a no-show.
        </li>
        <li>
            EVERYTHING DISCUSSED HERE SHOULD BE
            TAKEN AS CONFIDENTIAL;<br />
            What's said in group should stay in group.<br />
            Wear headphones if anyone is nearby.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, confidentiality can NOT be guaranteed.<br />
            So do NOT admit to any specific crimes.
        </li>
        <li>
            You're encouraged to CHIME IN if you have additional ideas about the portion of the module we're covering.<br />
            Consider asking clarifying questions and adding to the answers given by others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any disrespect to this group will REQUIRE AN APOLOGY.<br />
            Absolutely NO THREATS and NO VIOLENCE.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do NOT violate ANY restraining orders or no-contact orders, ever, not even as part of an assignment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="highlight">NO arguing; NO excuses; Please ASK to explain.<br />
                Continuing to argue will result in failure to progress.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            When speaking, FOCUS ON YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS.<br />
            YOU ARE THE PERPETRATOR, NOT THE VICTIM.
        </li>
        <li>
            Everybody has reasons...
            When speaking, focus on WHAT YOU DID, NOT WHY you did it.<br />
            If we need to know why then we'll ask.
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow the K.I.S.S. principle: "Keep It Short & Simple"<br />
            This means keep your answers as short & simple, as possible.<br />
            --2 to 3 sentences is usually plenty! Let us ask for more information, if we need it.<br />
            Otherwise you'll probably end up exposing more than necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Giving "reasons" can lead to failure.<br />
            --Unless they are specifically called for (otherwise they're "excuses").
        </li>
