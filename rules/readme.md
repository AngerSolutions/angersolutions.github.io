  <span style="background:pink;color:white">When in doubt: **Dial (541)383-2961** and **LEAVE A VOICE MESSAGE.**</span>


‚úèÔ∏è HOMEWORK
-----------

* PRINT answers, DO NOT USE CURSIVE, so it's easy to read.
* USE A PENCIL so answers are easy to change, as necessary.
* You must EMAIL PHOTOS of your completed homework ONCE, EACH WEEK, BEFORE GROUP begins.
* All images MUST be upright and legible.
* Homework will NOT be "reviewed" after submission.  
  Iron out any issues with your homework BEFORE SUBMITTING it, by asking specific questions.
* ALWAYS SEND ONE COMPLETE HOMEWORK SUBMISSION, per week, in its very own email.
  Each homework submission MUST be in its own, fresh email.  
  --Not in a reply to some other thread.
* Only ONE homework attachment is allowed, per week.  
  --THAT is your homework submission.
* Homework submissions MUST include the module number in the "Subject" line;  
  ONLY homework submissions may reference the module number in the "Subject" line.
* Do NOT place a module number in any other emails -- ONLY in your homework submission.
* If you fail to EMAIL YOUR COMPLETED HOMEWORK,  
  between the day following the current group and the next session,  
  then you won't progress to the next module.
* The previous week's assignment email submissions are NOT retained.
* _Additional homework may be assigned at ANY time._


üì∂ CONNECTION
-------------

* Your device is expected to be plugged in, at ALL times.  
  If your battery is dying do NOT interrupt the group.  
  Handle it on your own. It's NOT our problem.  
* If your connection drops, REJOIN MUTED.  
  Don't start apologizing when you reconnect.  
  --The group will continue without you.


üó£Ô∏è PARTICIPATION
----------------

* This is NOT counseling;  
  This is NOT therapy;  
  The group facilitator is neither a counselor, nor a therapist.
* You're strongly encouraged to use your initials, for your username, in this group.  
  At most, please use only your first name and last initial.
* Always be respectful and on-time.  
  After 1 minute you're late;  
  After 5 minutes you're a no-show.
* EVERYTHING DISCUSSED HERE SHOULD BE TAKEN AS CONFIDENTIAL;  
  What's said in group should stay in group.  
  Wear headphones if anyone is nearby.  
  However, confidentiality can NOT be guaranteed.  
  So do NOT admit to any specific crimes.  
* If you think you might cut it close making it to group on-time then take your workbook, a pencil, and phone with you so you can still participate.
* Show up, even if you didn't complete your homework, if you want your weekly report to state you were "present" and "in compliance".
* You're encouraged to CHIME IN when you have additional ideas about the portion of the module we're covering;  
  So ask clarifying questions and offer relevant & appropriate comments on answers given by others.
* Any disrespect to this group will REQUIRE AN APOLOGY.  
  Absolutely NO THREATS and NO VIOLENCE.
* Do NOT violate ANY restraining orders or no-contact orders, ever, not even as part of an assignment.
* **NO** arguing; **NO** excuses; Please **ASK** to explain.  
  Continuing to argue will result in failure to progress.
* When speaking, **FOCUS ON YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS.**  
  YOU ARE THE PERPETRATOR, NOT THE VICTIM.
* Follow the K.I.S.S. principle: _"Keep It Short & Simple"_  
  This means **keep your answers as short & simple as possible.**  
  --2 to 3 sentences is usually plenty! Let us ask for more information, if we need it.  
  Otherwise you'll probably end up exposing more than necessary.
* Everybody has reasons...  
  When speaking, **focus on WHAT YOU DID, NOT WHY you did it.**  
  The group will decide when, if ever, to talk about the "why".  
  --If we need to know why (ie. if we need to know the reason) then we will ask.
* Giving "reasons" can lead to failure, unless they are specifically called for.  
  (Otherwise they are just "excuses".  See next section.)


üöØ EXCUSES ARE NEVER ALLOWED
----------------------------

* ***MINIMIZING:***
    - "It only happened once ..."
    - "I'm not perfect ..."
    - "I barely raised my voice ..."
    - "I only got a little upset ..."
    - "I did better than I usually do ..."

* ***JUSTIFYING:***
    - "I'd already tried being patient with them ..."
    - "I won't put up with that ..."
    - "I wasn't in the mood ..."
    - "Nobody does that to my family ..."
    - "I warned them ..."
    - "I would've been late ..."
    - "It felt good ..."

* ***BLAMING:***
    - "He took a swing at me ..."
    - "They stole from me ..."
    - "She started yelling at me ..."
    - "I was drunk ..."
