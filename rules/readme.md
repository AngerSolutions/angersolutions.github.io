RULES FOR GROUP
===============

* _All rules subject to change without notice!_
* Follow **ALL** directions **VERY** carefully.
* When in doubt: **dial <a href="tel:5413832961">(541)383-2961</a>** and **leave a VOICE message.**


üì® EMAIL
--------

* ALWAYS send a new, fresh email for EACH question;  
  DON'T reply to old or unrelated email threads.
* DON'T combine emails;  
  Only ONE subject per message.
* DON'T include the module number unless it's your homework submission. (Page numbers are okay)
* NEVER forward Anger Solutions' emails to others.
* NEVER give out the Group Facilitator's email address, nor CC anyone to it.  
  Give them [anger.mgmt@protonmail.com](mailto:anger.mgmt@protonmail.com) instead.
* Emails are typically deleted, for privacy reasons, after viewing them.  
  DON'T assume Anger Solutions still has access to any old emails.


‚úèÔ∏è HOMEWORK
-----------

* ALWAYS send ONE complete homework submission, EVERY week:
  - BEFORE group begins.
  - In its very own fresh email --NOT in a reply to some other thread.
  - Subject line MUST include the module number.
  - Images of pages MUST be upright and COMPLETELY legible.
  - ALWAYS print answers, DON'T use cursive, so it's easy to read.
  - ALWAYS use a pencil so answers are easy to change, as necessary.

* Homework WON'T be "reviewed" after submission.  
  You can iron out issues with homework, BEFORE submitting it, by asking specific questions.
* Only ONE homework attachment is allowed, per week.  
  --THAT is your homework submission.
* The previous week's assignment email submissions are NOT retained.
* _Additional homework may be assigned at ANY time._


üì∂ CONNECTION
-------------

* Your device is expected to be plugged in, at ALL times.  
  If your battery is dying DON'T interrupt the group.  
  Handle it on your own. It's NOT our problem.  
* If your connection drops, rejoin MUTED.  
  DON'T start apologizing when you reconnect.  
  --The group will continue without you.


üó£Ô∏è PARTICIPATION
----------------

* This is NOT counseling;  
  This is NOT therapy;  
  The group facilitator is neither a counselor, nor a therapist.
* You're strongly encouraged to use your initials, for your username, in this group.  
  At most, please use only your first name and last initial.
* Always be respectful and on-time.  
  After 1 minute you're late;  
  After 5 minutes you're a no-show.
* EVERYTHING DISCUSSED HERE SHOULD BE TAKEN AS CONFIDENTIAL;  
  What's said in group should stay in group.  
  Wear headphones if anyone is nearby.  
  However, confidentiality can NOT be guaranteed.  
  So do NOT admit to any specific crimes.  
* If you think you might cut it close making it to group on-time then take your workbook, a pencil, and phone with you so you can still participate.
* Show up, even if you didn't complete your homework, to allow your weekly report to state you were "present" and "in compliance".
* You're encouraged to CHIME IN when you have additional ideas about the portion of the module we're covering;  
  So ask clarifying questions and offer relevant & appropriate comments on answers given by others.
* Any disrespect to this group will REQUIRE AN APOLOGY.  
  Absolutely NO THREATS and NO VIOLENCE.
* Do NOT violate ANY restraining orders or no-contact orders, ever, not even as part of an assignment.
* **NO** arguing; **NO** excuses; Please **ASK** to explain.  
  Continuing to argue will result in failure to progress.
* When speaking, **FOCUS ON YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS.**  
  YOU ARE THE PERPETRATOR, NOT THE VICTIM.
* Follow the K.I.S.S. principle: _"Keep It Short & Simple"_  
  This means **keep your answers as short & simple as possible.**  
  --2 to 3 sentences is usually plenty! Let us ask for more information, if we need it.  
  Otherwise you'll probably end up exposing more than necessary.
* Everybody has reasons...  
  When speaking, **focus on WHAT YOU DID, NOT WHY you did it.**  
  The group will decide when, if ever, to talk about the "why".  
  --If we need to know why (ie. if we need to know the reason) then we will ask.
* Giving "reasons" can lead to failure, unless they are specifically called for.  
  (Otherwise they are just "excuses".  See next section.)


üöØ EXCUSES ARE NEVER ALLOWED
----------------------------

* ***MINIMIZING:***
    - "It only happened once ..."
    - "I'm not perfect ..."
    - "I barely raised my voice ..."
    - "I only got a little upset ..."
    - "I did better than I usually do ..."

* ***JUSTIFYING:***
    - "I'd already tried being patient with them ..."
    - "I won't put up with that ..."
    - "I wasn't in the mood ..."
    - "Nobody does that to my family ..."
    - "I warned them ..."
    - "I would've been late ..."
    - "It felt good ..."

* ***BLAMING:***
